# 📊 Soccer Analytics: EPL & La Liga (2014/15–2015/16)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes two full seasons of the **English Premier League (EPL)** and **La Liga** (2014/15 & 2015/16). Using match-level data sourced from Kaggle, the analysis compares **team performance, tactical styles, and seasonal trends** across the two leagues.  

The project demonstrates a complete workflow using **Python for data cleaning and clustering, SQL for query practice, Power BI for dashboards, and PowerPoint for storytelling**.

## 🗂️ Dataset
- **Source**: Kaggle (European football dataset)  
- **Leagues**: English Premier League & La Liga  
- **Seasons**: 2014/15 and 2015/16  
- **Metrics analyzed**:  
  - Points earned  
  - Goals scored & conceded  
  - Possession percentage  
  - Shots & build-up play  
  - Clean sheets & defensive records  

---

## 🔎 Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning (Python)**  
   - Processed raw Kaggle dataset using **pandas**.  
   - Removed nulls, standardized columns, normalized stats (per-90).  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (Python)**  
   - Built visualizations with **matplotlib** and **seaborn**.  
   - Analyzed league standings, offense/defense metrics, and year-to-year changes.  

3. **Clustering Analysis (Python)**  
   - Applied clustering to group teams by playing style:  
     - Possession-dominant  
     - Counterattacking  
     - Balanced  
     - Defensive  

4. **SQL Practice**  
   - Wrote queries to practice data extraction (e.g., filtering matches by season/league, calculating team totals).  
   - Reinforced SQL skills while cross-checking Python outputs.  

5. **Dashboard Development (Power BI)**  
   - Designed interactive dashboards to filter by league and season.  
   - Visualized key stats (GF, GA, Possession %, Points).  

6. **Final Storytelling (PowerPoint)**  
   - Created a structured deck with captions, analysis, and key takeaways.  
   - Organized by league & season: EPL 14/15 → EPL 15/16 → La Liga 14/15 → La Liga 15/16 → Comparative wrap-up.

## 📊 Key Findings

### EPL 2014/15
- Chelsea dominated with defensive consistency.  
- Arsenal and Manchester City relied more on possession, but counterattacking sides thrived.  
- Greater **competitive balance** across the top 6 compared to La Liga.  

### EPL 2015/16
- Leicester City’s title highlighted the **power of counterattacking efficiency**.  
- Spurs balanced offense & defense, finishing second.  
- Traditional big clubs underperformed despite high possession stats.  

### La Liga 2014/15
- Barcelona’s **MSN trio** (Messi, Suárez, Neymar) dominated scoring.  
- Atlético Madrid showcased elite defense but lacked attacking depth.  
- Larger gap between top clubs and mid-table compared to EPL.  

### La Liga 2015/16
- Barcelona narrowly edged Real Madrid in a tighter race.  
- Atlético again led defensively, conceding the fewest goals.  
- La Liga teams leaned toward **possession dominance**.  

### Cross-League Comparison
- **EPL**: More tactical diversity; success not tied to possession.  
- **La Liga**: Top-heavy; possession-driven teams dominated.  
- Both leagues show that **different tactical contexts lead to success**.
